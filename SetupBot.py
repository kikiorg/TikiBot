# This class executes the setup procedures:
#   It's really just a big while loop that prompts the user for each setup command
#
#   [C]alibrate -- calibrate all the pumps
#   [G]lobal calibration check -- dispense 1oz for every pump; should be 12oz total
#   [P]rime -- prime all pumps
#   [T]iny Prime -- do small, incremental priming of each pump to calibrate the priming sequence
#   [S]hutdown full phase -- this includes all steps needed for the shutdown procedure
#       The user can step through them in order, or skip around by choosing the step number
