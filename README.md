# TikiBot
Code to run Spaceman Sam's TIKITRON DrinkBot

The TIKITRON Drinkbot is our third adventure in Cocktail robotics. The first was the COSMOBOT, which "launches" quality cosmic cocktails from a rocket ship. It uses an Arduino interfaced with a rotary dial in a "Mission Control" box for the user to choose a drink. Then the user would hit the big red video-game-style button to "Launch" the drink! 

The second one was The Tea Engine, which uses an Arduino interfaced with a vintage rotary dial telephone to solenoid valves inside a 1924 coffee percolator converted for tea-making.

This time, we are going full Tiki.  Tiki drinks are complicated. The Mai Tai, for example, requires seven ingredients. I decided to switch from Arduino to Raspberry Pi due to the project's complexity. Boy is it ever.  We are looking at twelve pumps for twelve bottles. We are using peristaltic pumps which have proven safer and more reliable than the pressure fed pumps which we used in COSMOBOT. 

For the show, we are building a Volcano. A Tiki God is carved in the side of the volcano.  Its mouth is large enough for a standard beer glass and most tiki mugs. 

To receive a drink, you must make a sacrifice! You read that right. We have various tiki statues with RFID tags on them. Each statue represents a drink. Drop one into the top of the Volcano, the Tiki God awakens, and a drink is dispensed. We had a lot of fun having our friends screaming into the microphone to record the different screams for each drink; the results were hilarious!

Needless to say, it is one of the most complicated project to date.  MANY MANY THANKS TO KIKI FOR DIVING DEEP INTO PYTHON! She is helping to make this magic happen, far faster than lowly Spaceman Sam.  I am forever grateful to her.

More to come!
