# TikiBot
Code to run Spaceman Sam's Tiki DrinkBot

The Tiki Drinkbot is our second adventure in Cocktail robotics. The first is the COSMOBOT, which "launches" fine cosmic cocktails from a rocket ship.

This time, we are going full Tiki.  Tiki drinks are complicated. The Mai Tai, for example, requires seven ingredients. I decided to switch from Arduino to Raspberry Pi due to the project's complexity. Boy is it ever.  We are looking at twelve pumps for twelve bottles which are chilled in a tray full of ice. We are using peristaltic pumps which have proven safer and more reliable than the pressure fed pumps which we used in COSMOBOT. 

For the show, we are building a Volcano. Using a combination of silk flame and a small fan, plus dry ice for smoke, plus LED lights for simulated Lava.  A Tiki God is carved in the side of the volcano.  Its mouth is large enough for a standard beer glass and most tiki mugs. 

To receive a drink, you must make a sacrifice. You read that right. We have various tiki statues with RFID tags on them. Drop one into the top of the Volcano, the Tiki God awakens, and a drink is dispensed.

Needless to say, it is one of the most complicated project to date.  MANY MANY THANKS TO KIKI FOR DIVING DEEP INTO PYTHON! She is helping to make this magic happen, far faster than lowly Spaceman Sam.  I am forever grateful to her.

More to come!
